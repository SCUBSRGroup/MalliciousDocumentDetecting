# MalliciousDocumentDetecting
Introduce
Advance persistent threat(APT) Nowdays has become a serious thread for our society,especially for some high-valued targets,like goverment、military、financial origination.As we know,when the attacker goes on APT attack,there are two ways that often use,which are Phishing attack and Malicious email attachments attack.The attacker offer use zero-day vulnerability or n-day vulnerability to penetrate their targets by sending a Malicious email attachments like doc、pdf、excel etc to their targets,while those attachments often tirger the vulnerability when be opend.So this project is  dedicated to detect those mailiciouse documents.
Firstly,we only want to detect document file:like doc、pdf、excel or some flash file.
Secondly,In the forepart of our work,we plan to use static analyse method to detect these mallicious files.
Thirdly,We may be use some dynamic analyse method to detect these fils.

Project application direction
1 System can access the mail gateway to detect the email attachments and clean up malicious documents early!
2 We can provide some web service for others to detect their suspicious object!
